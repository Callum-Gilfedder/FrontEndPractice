        <p style="position: relative; bottom: 61px; left: 12px;">Gained in-depth experience with <mark class="black"> Microsoft Azure</mark> by creating a 
            multitude of cloud tutorials over the past year <br> of employment. 
            Underwent 3 months of cloud training at the start of 
            employment, where I learnt the fundamentals <br> of the major cloud 
            platforms; Azure, AWS and GCP. Then branched out and took 
            deeper studies into Azure. <br> Successfully attained multiple Azure 
            cloud certifications, such as: <br>
            • <mark class="black">AZ-900: </mark> Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. <br>
            • <mark class="black">AI-900: </mark>Azure AI Fundamentals.<br>
            • <mark class="black"> DP-900: </mark> Azure Data Fundamentals.<br>
            Achieved the highest grades in the company with my DP-900 
            grade being 925/1000. This gives me a solid understanding <br>
            of both Azure and <mark class="black"> AI/ML and data science. </mark>  After completion 
            of training, created and maintained a multitude of beginner <br>
            to advanced level courses for cloud professionals. Expertly 
            fulfilled my main responsibility of creating Microsoft Azure <br>
            cloud tutorials, by producing the highest quantity and quality of 
            tutorials on my team, with a personal decision to focus <br>on AI/ML 
            and data science based tutorials. Additionally created a range 
            of GCP tutorials. <mark class="black"> Created over 80 highly <br> professional tutorials </mark> 
            and responsibly managed over 300. Copiously populated the 
            companies platform with a diverse <br> range of high-quality 
            tutorials. 
            Separate focus was also placed on non-cloud based tutorials. 
            Independently taught <br> myself the basics of programming 
            languages such as <mark class="black"> R, Go, JavaScript, HTML and CSS </mark> as well 
            as useful supplementary <br>Python libraries such as <mark class="black"> TensorFlow 
            and Pandas </mark>. Created full length courses aimed at providing the 
            customer with a solid <br>understanding of a larger topic than the 
            stand-alone tutorials. Produced exemplary full-length courses on R, Go and <br> Pandas.
