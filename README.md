# Front end practice

Front end practice project

**TO-DO:**
* ~~Make sure the toggle theme icon is working correctly.~~
* ~~Get a profile picture with a green background to match theme.~~
* ~~Redesign portfolio page, don't like current set-up.~~
* ~~Finish portfolio page.~~
* ~~Start contact me page.~~
* ~~Finish HTML and CSS before moving onto JS.~~
* Could add additional CSS fade in animations to make the flow of the fade ins on pages with more elemnets look nicer.
* Also want to implement a delayed fade in animation on the tertiary colored text.
* Could add CSS slide animations possibly?
* On the Home page, could add some CSS text animation?

* Once completed the JS implementations, we need to try create a new website with a responsive design or we need to adapt this one.
* Experience and education page is not good enough.




**Learn JS for web development before attempting these** 
* Theme toggle resets when clicking on new page? Fix.
* Add functionality to contact me form.
