# Front end practice

Front end practice project

This is a practice front end project. This is a functional website that includes a dark / light theme that uses JS to remember the state of the theme when traversing over different pages. It has some basic CSS transitions and a functional contact form that uses an api to send myself emails.

**Possible improvements:**
* Website is not reactive to changes in screen size. Therefore not compatible with mobile devices. Use CSS grid / flexbox for next iteration.
* Design of experience and portfolio pages could be redone, not the most aesthetically pleasing pages.


**TO-DO:**
* Could add additional CSS fade in animations to make the flow of the fade ins on pages with more elemnets look nicer.
* Also want to implement a delayed fade in animation on the tertiary colored text.
* Could add CSS slide animations possibly?
* On the Home page, could add some CSS text animation?
* Once completed the JS implementations, we need to try create a new website with a responsive design or we need to adapt this one.
* Experience and education page is not good enough.
