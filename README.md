# Front end practice

This is a practice front end project. This is a functional website that includes a dark / light theme that uses JS to remember the state of the theme when traversing over different pages. It has some basic CSS transitions and a functional contact form that uses an api to send myself emails.

**Possible improvements:**
* Website is not reactive to changes in screen size. Therefore not compatible with mobile devices. Use CSS grid / flexbox for next iteration.
* Design of experience and portfolio pages could be redone, not the most aesthetically pleasing pages.


**TO-DO:**

* Home page is fine. No changes needed as of now.
* On every page, the navigation button to the next page looks bad, change this.
* The experience and education page needs to be entirely redone.
* The portfolio and CV page doesn't look great.
* The contact me page is acceptable but the form needs to be updated to look much more professional.

**Done:**
* ~~ Black background is too harsh, change to a slightly light black. ~~
* ~~ White background might have same issue. ~~
